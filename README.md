## About

This project predicts the 1st innings score in an IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match. Leveraging historical IPL data and machine learning models, the notebook provides users with a tool to estimate the target score that can be expected based on match conditions and inputs.

## Features

- Predicts 1st innings IPL cricket scores
- Built with Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
- Utilizes machine learning for score prediction
- Easy to use and extend

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GauravPandey05/Ipl-score-Predictor.git
   cd Ipl-score-Predictor
   ```

2. **Set up a Python environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Open the notebook and install required packages. Common dependencies may include:
   - pandas
   - numpy
